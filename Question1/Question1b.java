// Scenario: Secure Bank PIN Policy Upgrade
// 1 b)
// A bank is implementing a new PIN security policy to strengthen customer account protection. Every
// customer's banking PIN must meet the following criteria:
// 1. The PIN must be between 6 and 20 characters (inclusive).
// 2. It must contain at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, and one digit.
// 3. It must not contain three consecutive repeating characters (e.g., "AAA123" is weak, but
// "AA123B" is strong).
// The bank wants to ensure all PINs comply with these security rules.
// Given a string pin_code, return the minimum number of changes required to make it strong. If the PIN
// is already strong, return 0.
// In one step, you can:
//  Insert a character.
//  Delete a character.
//  Replace one character with another character.
