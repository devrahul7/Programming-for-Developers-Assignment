// Question 1 a)
// Maximizing Tech Startup Revenue before Acquisition
// A tech startup, AlgoStart, is planning to get acquired by a larger company. To negotiate a higher
// acquisition price, AlgoStart wants to increase its revenue by launching a few high-return projects.
// However, due to limited resources, the startup can only work on at most k distinct projects before the
// acquisition.
// You are given n potential projects, where the i-th project has a projected revenue gain of revenues[i]
// and requires a minimum investment capital of investments[i] to launch.
// Initially, AlgoStart has c capital. When a project is completed, its revenue gain is added to the
// startupâ€™s total capital, which can then be reinvested into other projects.
// Your task is to determine the maximum possible capital AlgoStart can accumulate after completing at

// most k projects.  [5 Marks]
